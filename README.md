# Representation-Learning
Programming assignments for the course IFT6135 Representation Learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Assignement 1

### Problem 1: MLP
In this problem, we will build a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and train it on the MNIST hand-
written digit dataset.

You can find the code for the first problem in the python script (mlp.py) under the folder problem 1.

```
python mlp.py
```

### Problem 2: CNN
For this part of the assignment we will train a convolutional network on MNIST using Pytorch.

You can find the code for the second problem in the python script under the folder problem 2.

```
python cnn.py
```

### Problem 3: Kaggle competition
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/ift6135h19)
Dogs vs. Cats is an InclassKaggle challenge for image classification. We trained a CNN classifier for this task.

You can find the code for the third problem in the jupyter notebook script (cnn.py) under the folder problem 3.
