\Exercise{
\label{ex:1dconv_eval}
Compute the \textit{full}, \textit{valid}, and \textit{same} convolution (with kernel flipping) for the following 1D matrices: $\begin{bmatrix}1,2,3,4\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}1,0,2\end{bmatrix}$
}

\Answer{
Assuming that the given kernel is not already flipped: Flipped kernel: $[2,0,1]$\\
All convolutions are done with stride: 1\\
Full convolution (with double zero padding): $[0,0,1,2,3,4,0,0]*[2,0,1]=[1,2,5,6,6,8]$\\
Same convolution (with zero padding): $[0,1,2,3,4,0]*[2,0,1]=[2,5,8,6]$\\
Valid convolution:$[1,2,3,4]*[2,0,1]=[5,8]$
