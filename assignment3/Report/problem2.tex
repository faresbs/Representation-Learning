\section*{Problem 2}
\begin{itemize}
     \item[A.]{Training VAE}\\
     We used the given architecture and ADAM with the provided learning rate. After training the model for 20 Epochs, we achieved an average value of ELBO of $-95$ on validation set. It is clearly higher than the reference value provided in question.  
     
     \item[B.1]{Evaluating log-likelihood with VAE}\\
     Here we implement the Importance Sampling procedure that takes as parameters the trained model, an array of $x_i$ and an array of samples $z_{ik}$ from the distribution $q(z|x_i)$. The procedure returns an array of log-likelihood $\log p(x_i)$  of the size of the mini-batches.The code snippet below demonstrates our implementation.

     \item[B.2]
     The evaluation of the training model using the ELBO:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item [a.] Validation: $-95$
         \item [b.] Test: $-94.43$
     \end{itemize}
     The evaluation of the training model using the log-likelihood:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item [a.] Validation: $-18.41$
         \item [b.] Test: $-18.27$
     \end{itemize}
     Below (Figure \ref{fig:gen_sample}) is a sample of the obtained images generated by the trained model:
