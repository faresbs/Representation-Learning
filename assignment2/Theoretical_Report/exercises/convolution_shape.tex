\Exercise{
\label{ex:convolution_shape}
Consider a convolutional neural network. 
Assume the input is a colorful image of size $256 \times 256$ in the RGB representation. 
The first layer convolves 64 $8 \times 8$ kernels with the input, using a stride of 2 and no padding. 
The second layer downsamples the output of the first layer with a $5 \times 5$ non-overlapping max pooling. 
The third layer convolves 128 $4 \times 4$ kernels with a stride of 1 and a zero-padding of size 1 on each border.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the dimensionality (scalar) of the output of the last layer? 
\item Not including the biases, how many parameters are needed for the last layer?
\end{enumerate}
