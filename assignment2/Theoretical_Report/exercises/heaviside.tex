\Exercise{
\label{ex:heaviside}
Using the following definition of the derivative and the definition of the Heaviside step function:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = 
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\ \frac{f(x + \epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon}
\qquad\quad
H(x)=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $x > 0$}\\
\frac{1}{2} & \text{if $x = 0$}\\
0 & \text{if $x < 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the derivative of the rectified linear unit $g(x) = \max\{0, x\}$, \textbf{wherever it exists}, is equal to the Heaviside step function.

\item Give two alternative definitions of $g(x)$ using $H(x)$.

\item Show that $H(x)$ can be well approximated by the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-k{x}}}$ asymptotically (i.e for large $k$), where $k$ is a parameter. 
%\item Show that the derivative of $H(x)$ is equal to $$\delta(x)=\begin{cases}
%\infty & \textnormal{if $x = 0$}\\
%0 & \textnormal{if $x \neq 0$.}
%\end{cases}$$

\staritem Although the Heaviside step function is not differentiable, we can define its {\bf distributional derivative}. 
For a function $F$, consider the functional $F[\phi] = \int_{\R}F(x)\phi(x)d x$, where $\phi$ is a smooth function (infinitely differentiable) with compact support ($\phi(x)= 0$ whenever  $|x| \geq A$, for some $A>0$). 

Show that whenever $F$ is differentiable, 
$F'[\phi] = - \int_{\R}F(x)\phi'(x)d x$.  
Using this formula as a definition in the case of non-differentiable functions, show that $H'[\phi]=\phi(0)$. 
($\delta[\phi]\doteq\phi(0)$ is known as the Dirac delta function.)
\end{enumerate}
