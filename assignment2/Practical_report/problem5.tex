\section{Problem 5: Detailed evaluation of trained models}
For points 1 and 2 we made a slight modification to the models, the update is in file models5.py.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
We compute the average loss for all the validation sequences at each time step. The main script has been modified to load a pre-trained model and process the validation model while computing the loss at each time step individually(This is indicated in the script ptb-lm-P5-1.py under "Loss computation", Line 405). The resulting curves for the three models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:5_1}. \\
The loss is clearly larger when the training starts as the model does not have much information about the sequence at hand and cannot predict accurately. As we proceed, all the models should start making better predictions and thus the reduction of the loss. Although the loss fluctuates, it seems to be stabilizing around certain values, of which the RNN loss shows a higher loss while the GRU and Transformer perform similarly to each other but better than RNN. 
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{loss_t-step}
	\caption{text}
	\label{fig:5_1}
\end{figure}
\item
Similarly to point 1 above, we modified the main script (see ptb-lm-P5-2.py under LOSS COMPUTATION on line 405). Here instead of processing the whole sequence at each step, we only run one mini-batch, processing each time step separately without touching the hidden states. This allows us to compute the gradient at time $T$ with respect to the hidden state at each time step $t$. \\
We compute the norm of the concatenated gradient vectors for the different layers and plot them with respect to the time steps as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:5_2}. Note that the values for each curve are rescaled to be in the range $[0,1]$. This way we can compare the behavior of the gradients of the two different models (RNN and GRU). The graph shows how the gradients with respect to earlier time-steps are smaller than the gradients with respect to later times. This indicates that long-term dependencies contribute less to the gradient at a given point. The drop in the dependency is particularly steep on the RNN model. On the other hand, the mechanics of GRU help better mainatining the long-term dependencies.

	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{gradsL_wrt_ht}

	\label{fig:5_2}
\end{figure}
\item
We generate samples from both the simple RNN and GRU. We use the models from section 4.1. The sampling code can be find in the script generate.py. We produce 20 samples from RNN and GRU, 10 samples of the same length as the training sequnences (35) and 10 samples that are twice the length of the training sequeneces (70). The samples can be found in the Appendix of the report. 

\paragraph{Extras}
Given the interesting results with text generation, we decided to experiment with more things like trying different temperature values and transforming text to audio (you find the audio samples under audio folder in github).

We experience with temperature values in order to control the randomness of the sample generation by scaling the logits before applying softmax. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	High temperature: 
	
	\textbf{around poison book hitting german stimulators cooperative response barred remodeling contractor clearance vermont institutional overseas taught opening shape europeans collecting harold cananea clean strikes bulls peripheral direct sydney birds pitney peoples balls surrendered amount}
	
	\item 
	Low temperature:
	
	\textbf{and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and <eos> and and and and <eos> and <eos> and and and and and and and and <eos>}	
	
\end{enumerate}

High temperature values gives more complex diverse samples however low values gives more confident but very repetitive samples. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item three best samples:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		\textit{glass of factories scrap bonds laws counterpart properties yen south crude the <unk> investments N mortgages u.k. bonds bonds N debentures bonds N deposits bonds interests french debentures bonds bonds swiss bonds bonds bonds bond bonds debentures securities bank bonds bonds bonds bonds one-year bonds bonds bonds bonds eurobonds eurobonds freddie <unk> freddie bonds bonds bonds <eos> bonds backed bonds notes bonds bonds bonds west certificates bonds bonds notes bonds

	\end{enumerate}

	\item three bad samples:

	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

From the samples we can see that in the case of GRU, we have very distant related words than in the case RNN.
